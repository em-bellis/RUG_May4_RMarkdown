## What is Markdown?

- Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

- Provides a standard way of formatting text, like  

  *italics*  
  **bold**  
  `code`  
  - lists, and    
    - [links](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)  
    - Latex equations like  $E = mc^{2}$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\beta_i$ 
    - and bibliographies <!-- This is a comment. -->

## What is Markdown?

- BUT original version did not include syntax for tables, footnotes, math expressions, or citations

- Enter [pandoc](https://pandoc.org), a 'swiss-army knife' for converting between markup formats 

- *A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text; markup language is not shown when the document is processed for display*

## What is R Markdown?

- "R markdown" document format was first introduced in 2012 as part of **knitr** package, enabling users to embed code chunks in Markdown documents.

- The **rmarkdown** package, first created in 2014, provides an 'ecosystem' for authoring documents.

## Slide with R Output
```{r starwars, echo = TRUE, warning=F, message=F}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
kable(starwars[1:5,c(1:3,5,8:10)])
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r , echo = TRUE, warning=F, fig.height=3.5, fig.cap="Star Wars Character Biodiversity"}
library(ggplot2)
library(beyonce)
tmp <- starwars %>% group_by(species)%>% summarise(total= n()) %>% filter(total > 1)
ggplot(tmp, aes(x=species, y=total, fill=species)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + scale_fill_manual(values = beyonce_palette(75, n=9,type="discrete"))  

```


## What is R Markdown?
R Markdown also supports other languages, such as Python, Julia, C++, and SQL thanks to the **knitr** package, which provides a large number of language engines. 

Language engines are essentially functions registered in the object `knitr::knit_engine`.
```{r knitr, echo=TRUE}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

## Rendering a .Rmd file
**R Studio:**    
    * Click the *Knit* button to generate document that includes both content and output of any embedded R code chunks within the document  

**R Console:**  

`rmarkdown::render('/path/to/file/Intro.Rmd')`  

**CLI:**  

`Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('./Intro.Rmd')"`

## Some Additional Notes  
-Sensitive to spacing
-Line with one trailing space 
-Line with two spaces  
-Another line 

- Commenting with SHIFT+COMMAND+C (on a mac)
<!-- This is my favorite thing but note even if you just highlight a section it does the whole line -->
